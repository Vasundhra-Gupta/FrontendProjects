//Canvas
The <canvas> element serves as a container for graphics, which can be rendered via scripting.

We use canvas for graphics(drawing shapes, graphs), dynamic content and Interactivity.

Its important attributes are width and height.

//Character sets
essential concept in html, influencing how textual content is displayed and interpreted by the browser.
UTF-8
ISO-8859
ASCII(American Standard Code for Information Interchange)

//CSS Specificity
for same type of selection, bottom-most code is implemented.
Inline: 1000
Id selectors: 100
class, attributes, pseudo classes: 10
elements, pseudo elements, selectors: 1

//Float and clear
    Float property is used to wrap text and elements around another element(say image).
    float:right; means there will be no content on right of float, aloowed on left only.
    But when text overflow, img doesn't give its container. So we use {display: flow root;} then.
    clear: right; means element will not wrap around right-floated elements.

    Clear property prevents elements from wrapping around preceding floated elements.
    clear: none; means the elements will allow wrapping (Default value)
//!important is used to over prioritise all other styles.
like {property: value !important} 

//More on CSS selectors
using the universal selector locally
boxes *{

}

//CSS position
we need to set position frst if we wanna set z index.
relative position means we can shift its position from current
In absolute position, it shifts wrt its nearest positioned parent.
transform, filter and perspective properties can also make an element appear positioned.
